# NeppyBot Picture Repo

## What is NeppyBot?

NeppyBot is a closed source (for now) python 3 bot posting cute Neptunia pics every 20 minutes on Twitter, the Fediverse and Telegram.

- Twitter : [@NeppyBot](https://twitter.com/NeppyBot)

- Fediverse : [@NeppyBot@pl.smuglo.li](https://pl.smuglo.li/users/NeppyBot)

- Telegram : [t.me/neppygram](https://t.me/neppygram)

## What is the purpose of this repo?

I will resume that in 2 points:

- Let people add pictures by letting a PR in this repo.

- Sorting properly all pictures (cauz' you know, 1k+ pictures can be kind of a mess to deal with)

## That's cool! How can i submit a picture?

Before doing a pull request, check if your picture is already in the repo.
Since i sorted out all pics, it should take 1-2 minutes to check that.

If your picture is not in the repo, you can start making a pull request.
You have to sort your picture in the correct folder and rename it to match the pattern.

If your PR is merged, the picture will be in the bot when it will renew the local pics folder on the server.

## Do you plan to mention original artists at some point?

Yes! When every picture will be renamed, a CREDITS.md will be in each folder of this repo, so we can put the artist name/pseudo and the sauce.

## What the ****? Some files are not renamed correctly!

I didn't finished renaming all the files.
Actually, only the Solo and Duo folders have all pictures renamed correctly.
If you want to help with that, feel free to do a PR!
